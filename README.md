Roll Dice Game using Java

We can use java programming language to code any program therefore by using this 
language I am going to make a small game called “Rolled Dice”. In this game we are not using a 
real dice or any graphically designed dice instead we are using a random number when the 
player input the command roll the dice a random number will printed. So, in this game there 
are three levels, and this game can be played by two players. When the game starts the one of 
the players must enter a lucky number then the two players can start to roll the dice turn by 
turn so the one who go the lucky number first will be the winner. So, after playing the first level
if the players wish to continue the game can go to the next level otherwise can end the game.
In the second level again one of the two players must give a lucky number and the number of 
times they wish to play. After providing the numbers they can start to roll the dice and when 
each of the player got the lucky number it will be counted and after finishing the turns the total 
counts will be calculated and the one who got the highest count will be the winner. . So, after
playing the second level if the players wish to continue the game can go to the next level
otherwise can end the game. In the third level Also one of the players must enter the no rounds 
the players wish to play. Next, they can start to roll the dice so when they got a random number 
they will earned starts according to the random number and the stars will be printed. Finally,
the turns are exceeded the total number of stars will be counted and the one who got the 
highest no of stars will be the winner and it is the end of the game.
